# Sentiment_Analysis_Using_ML
This GitHub repository features a sentiment analysis project based on machine learning techniques applied to an Amazon review dataset for various musical instruments. The project utilizes popular machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors, implemented in Python. 
Sentiment analysis is important because it allows us to analyze people's opinions, emotions, and attitudes towards a particular topic or product. It has many applications in fields such as marketing, customer service, and social media analysis. By understanding people's sentiments, companies can improve their products and services, tailor their marketing campaigns, and enhance their customer experience. Sentiment analysis can also be used in areas such as politics, finance, and healthcare to gather insights and make informed decisions.
The sentiment analysis project on Amazon review dataset can be used by companies or individuals who want to analyze customer feedback on musical instruments sold on Amazon. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the project can classify customer reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This can help businesses to understand the overall customer satisfaction level and identify areas for improvement. It can also be used by individuals who want to make informed purchase decisions by analyzing the sentiments of previous customers. The project can be further extended to analyze customer feedback on other products sold on Amazon or other e-commerce platforms.
